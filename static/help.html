    “Play” button on the navigation bar on the top of the screen.

    Above the questions there is question number that shows what is the total
    number of questions and what is the number of the question that is being
    answered at the moment. To the right of the question numbering element is
    the current score window. Each question is worth 10 points and whenever you
    answer the question correctly, 10 points are added to your score. The timer
    is placed under the questions. For each question you have between 5 and 15
    seconds to answer the question before that questions is skipped and marked
    as incorrectly answered.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    After answering a question, the background of the answer you chose will
    turn green if the answer was correct or red if it was wrong with the
    correct answer being green, as shown in the examples(Picture 5 and Picture
